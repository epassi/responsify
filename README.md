#Responsify

This repository is a site template for designers to simulate responsive layouts with static comps or wireframes. When a set of layout comps are added to a designated folder in the site, a Grunt automation task will generate a corresponding HTML prototype that gathers the comps into a single responsive page.

###Required software
You'll need to install this software before using Responsify. This has been tested on Mac OS only. 

1. [Node.js](http://http://nodejs.org/) runtime
2. [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) command line interface (CLI) via terminal:  
`npm install -g grunt-cli`
3. [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) package manager via terminal:  
`ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
4. [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/) image processor via terminal:  
`brew install imagemagick`
5. [GraphicsMagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/) image processor via terminal:  
`brew install graphicsmagick`

###Using Responsify
1. Gather your layout comps or wireframes and name the files using their corresponding breakpoint. The breakpoint should be the minimum density-independent pixel width (CSS pixel width) of the viewport. Example: Home@320.png, Home@640.png, ProductDetail@320.jpg, ProductDetail@640.jpg, etc. See note below regarding high resolution comps.
2. Create your new site by cloning this repository:  
`git clone http://github.com/epassi/responsify "my-web-project-name"`
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `grunt`. Build preview will open in browser.
5. Drag your files into the `/layouts` folder. Build preview will update in browser. Build update could take a few seconds, depending on how many files you drag at a time.
6. Resize the browser to see your layouts respond to the changing viewport.

###Using Responsify with high resolution comps
Responsify uses the pixel width of your comp and the filename breakpoint to determine if the comp is intended for a high density display. If the comp width and breakpoint don't match, Responify assumes you're targeting a high density display. When naming a high resolution comp file, make sure the breakpoint is set to the CSS pixel width of the target viewport, not the pixel width of your comp.

**Example: Apple Retina displays**. Retina diplays have a 2:1 pixel ratio. If you create a high resolution comp that's 2000px wide, the breakpoint should be 1000. Your filename would be `My_Web_Page@1000.png`. 

**Example: super high density Android displays**. Some Android devices can have pixel ratios as high as 3:1. If you create a high resolution comp that's 3000px wide, the breakpoint should be 1000. Your filename would be `My_Web_Page@1000.png`.

Responsify supports only one comp per layout. You can't supply multiple layout comps to address different display densities. However, Responsify will automatically generate a lower resolution version of your comp to ensure backward compatibility with older browsers.

###Sharing your prototype site
The `dist` folder (generated by Grunt) contains the minimum set of files for displaying your prototype site. Host these files on a web server or zip up the folder and send via email.
