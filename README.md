#Responsify

Created for designers, this repository serves as a template for generating a single responsive page from a set of layout comps or wireframes. Helpful for simulating a responsive layout.

At the moment, you can generate only one page. Future versions aim to generate multiple pages.

###Requirements
You'll need to install these before using Responsify.

* Node.js
* Grunt CLI
* Brew
* GraphicsMagick

This has been tested on Mac OS only. 

###Using Responsify
1. Create your new site by cloning this repository 
2. Gather your layout comps or wireframes and name the files using their corresponing breakpoint. Example: 320.png, 600.png, 900.png, etc. **PNG format only.**
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `grunt`. Build preview will open in browser.
5. Drag your PNGs into the `/layouts` folder. Build preview will update in browser.
6. Resize the browser to see your layouts respond to the changing viewport.

###Sharing your prototype page
The `dist` folder (generated by Grunt) contains the minimum set of files for displaying your prototype. Host these files on a web server or zip up the folder and send via email.
